## Options Visualizer Project Notes

### Issues
- High-frequency noise and oscillations in interpolated option prices, particularly for long-dated options (LEAPS)
- Oscillatory behavior in SPY options data for the 2027-12-17 expiration date (DTE=1020) in the 450-650 strike range
- Second derivatives of option prices showing significant oscillations, particularly in put options
- Insufficient smoothing in the implied volatility (IV) surface interpolation
- Fixed smoothing parameter regardless of days to expiration (DTE)
- Long-dated options (LEAPS) require more aggressive smoothing due to their higher sensitivity to small IV changes
- Race conditions in data fetching process causing errors during reinterpolation

### Ground Truths
- Option prices exhibit convex behavior across strikes due to the underlying asset's distribution
- Implied volatility surfaces are typically smoother than price surfaces and better suited for interpolation
- Using Black-Scholes with interpolated IV produces more realistic option prices than direct price interpolation
- Proper synchronization is essential when dealing with background threads and shared resources
- Applying appropriate smoothing to the IV surface is critical for reducing noise in the final option prices
- Option prices for long-dated options are more sensitive to small changes in implied volatility
- Interpolation methods need to be adapted based on the time to expiration
- Proper dimension handling is critical when working with multi-dimensional arrays in numpy/xarray

### Hypotheses
- The adaptive smoothing approach may need further refinement for extremely long-dated options (> 2 years)
- Different underlying assets may benefit from different smoothing parameters based on their volatility characteristics
- The cubic interpolation of IV surfaces may still produce artifacts in certain edge cases
- The Black-Scholes model may not fully capture the market dynamics for deep ITM or OTM options

### Next Steps
1. Monitor the visualization for any remaining artifacts
2. Consider implementing more sophisticated volatility models if needed
3. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging for better diagnostics
4. Optimize performance of the interpolation methods for faster processing
5. Consider adaptive smoothing parameters based on the characteristics of the data
6. Explore alternative interpolation methods that may be more suitable for financial option data

### Repo Conventions
- Backend API runs on port 5002
- Options data is cached to improve performance
- Interpolation is used to fill gaps in options data
- Background threads are used for data fetching and cache refreshing

### Data Structures
- `OptionsDataManager`: Central manager for options data handling
- `OptionsDataProcessor`: Processes raw options data into an xarray Dataset
- `OptionsCache`: Manages caching of options data
- Options data is stored in xarray Datasets with dimensions:
  - strike: Option strike prices
  - expiration: Option expiration dates
  - option_type: Call or Put
- API returns JSON with the following structure:
  - status: Status of the request (complete, partial, loading, not_found)
  - ticker: The stock ticker symbol
  - current_price: Current price of the underlying asset
  - expiry_dates: List of available expiration dates
  - options_data: Array of option contracts with attributes like strike, expiration, option_type, bid, ask, etc.

### Plot Types Implementation
- The application now supports the following plot types:
  1. **Price**: Option mid-price (average of bid and ask)
  2. **Delta**: First derivative of option price with respect to underlying price (sensitivity to price changes)
  3. **Gamma**: Second derivative of option price with respect to underlying price (rate of change of delta)
  4. **Theta**: Rate of change of option price with respect to time (time decay)
  5. **Implied Volatility (IV)**: Market's expectation of future volatility derived from option prices
  6. **Volume**: Trading volume for each option contract
  7. **Spread**: Difference between ask and bid prices (bid-ask spread)
  8. **Intrinsic Value**: The value an option would have if exercised immediately
  9. **Extrinsic Value**: The premium above intrinsic value (time value and volatility premium)

- Implementation details:
  - Delta, gamma, and theta are calculated using both numerical methods and Black-Scholes formulas
  - Implied volatility is derived from market prices using the Black-Scholes model
  - Intrinsic value is calculated as max(0, S-K) for calls and max(0, K-S) for puts
  - Extrinsic value is calculated as (option price - intrinsic value)
  - Spread is calculated as (ask price - bid price)

# Options Visualizer Improvements

## Fields Implemented
The following fields have been implemented and are now available for visualization:

1. **Price** - Uses the mid_price field (average of bid and ask)
2. **Delta** - First derivative of option price with respect to underlying price
3. **Gamma** - Second derivative of option price with respect to underlying price
4. **Theta** - Rate of change of option price with respect to time
5. **IV (Implied Volatility)** - Displayed as percentage in the UI
6. **Volume** - Trading volume for the option
7. **Spread** - Difference between ask and bid prices
8. **Intrinsic Value** - The value of the option if exercised immediately
9. **Extrinsic Value** - The time value component of the option price

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `apply_floors` method
- Added handling for the spread field
- Added constraints for delta, gamma, and theta
- Improved handling of implied volatility with both floor (0.01) and cap (5.0)
- Ensured all dollar-denominated fields are rounded to the nearest $0.05

### 2. Updated `post_process_data` method
- Fixed dimension mismatch error by using proper indexing with isel() instead of boolean masks
- Implemented separate processing for calls and puts to avoid broadcasting issues

# Race Condition Fixes in Options Visualizer

## Issues Identified
1. Race conditions in data fetching (`_fetch_options_data`) causing "Cannot ensure plot fields: dataset is None" errors
2. Missing `risk_free_rate` attribute in the `OptionsDataProcessor` class
3. Concurrent access to the SQLite cache causing "no such column: timestamp" errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Per-Ticker Locks in Cache Manager
- Added a `ticker_locks` dictionary to the `OptionsCache` class to store per-ticker locks
- Implemented a `get_lock(ticker)` method to get or create a lock for a specific ticker
- Modified `get()`, `set()`, `clear()`, and `delete()` methods to use ticker-specific locks

### 2. Fixed Race Conditions in Options Data Manager
- Modified `_fetch_in_background` method to use ticker-specific locks
- Added proper lock acquisition around critical sections:
  - API data fetching
  - Data processing
  - Cache updates
- Added checks for None dataset before accessing attributes
- Wrapped cache access with appropriate locks

### 3. Fixed OptionsDataProcessor Issues
- Properly initialized `risk_free_rate` attribute in the constructor
- Added null checks before accessing dataset attributes
- Improved error handling in methods that access the dataset
- Enhanced the `get_risk_free_rate()` method to handle errors gracefully

### 4. General Improvements
- Added better error handling throughout the code
- Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues
- Improved thread safety in all critical sections
- Added checks to prevent accessing attributes of None objects

These changes should prevent the race conditions and errors seen in the logs, making the application more stable and reliable.

# Interpolation Method Improvements

## Changes Made to Interpolation Methods

### 1. Removed 1D Interpolation Fallback
- Eliminated the 1D interpolation fallback for single expiration dates
- Now using 2D interpolation exclusively for all cases
- This provides more consistent results across different datasets

### 2. Updated 2D Interpolation Method
- Now using xarray's built-in `interpolate_na` method for primary interpolation
- First converting zero values to NaN for proper interpolation
- Interpolating along strike dimension first, then along DTE dimension
- Using scipy's `griddata` for any remaining NaN values after xarray interpolation

### 3. Improved Smoothing Process
- Separated smoothing into its own method `_apply_smoothing`
- Applied adaptive smoothing based on days to expiration (DTE)
- Handling NaN values properly during smoothing by replacing with nearest valid values
- Applying smoothing only to fields that benefit from it (price fields and implied volatility)

### 4. Enhanced Zero Value Handling
- Now explicitly converting zeros to NaN for fields where zero is not a valid value
- Preserving zeros for fields like volume and openInterest where zero is meaningful
- This ensures more accurate interpolation results

### 5. Better Error Handling
- Added more robust error handling throughout the interpolation process
- Improved logging to better track the interpolation progress and identify issues
- Added checks to prevent operations on None datasets

These changes should result in smoother, more accurate interpolation of options data, especially for sparse datasets with many missing values.
