## Options Visualizer Project Notes

### Issues
- High-frequency noise and oscillations in interpolated option prices, particularly for long-dated options (LEAPS)
- Oscillatory behavior in SPY options data for the 2027-12-17 expiration date (DTE=1020) in the 450-650 strike range
- Second derivatives of option prices showing significant oscillations, particularly in put options
- Insufficient smoothing in the implied volatility (IV) surface interpolation
- Fixed smoothing parameter regardless of days to expiration (DTE)
- Long-dated options (LEAPS) require more aggressive smoothing due to their higher sensitivity to small IV changes
- Race conditions in data fetching process causing errors during reinterpolation

### Ground Truths
- Option prices exhibit convex behavior across strikes due to the underlying asset's distribution
- Implied volatility surfaces are typically smoother than price surfaces and better suited for interpolation
- Using Black-Scholes with interpolated IV produces more realistic option prices than direct price interpolation
- Proper synchronization is essential when dealing with background threads and shared resources
- Applying appropriate smoothing to the IV surface is critical for reducing noise in the final option prices
- Option prices for long-dated options are more sensitive to small changes in implied volatility
- Interpolation methods need to be adapted based on the time to expiration
- Proper dimension handling is critical when working with multi-dimensional arrays in numpy/xarray

### Hypotheses
- The adaptive smoothing approach may need further refinement for extremely long-dated options (> 2 years)
- Different underlying assets may benefit from different smoothing parameters based on their volatility characteristics
- The cubic interpolation of IV surfaces may still produce artifacts in certain edge cases
- The Black-Scholes model may not fully capture the market dynamics for deep ITM or OTM options

### Next Steps
1. Monitor the visualization for any remaining artifacts
2. Consider implementing more sophisticated volatility models if needed
3. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging for better diagnostics
4. Optimize performance of the interpolation methods for faster processing
5. Consider adaptive smoothing parameters based on the characteristics of the data
6. Explore alternative interpolation methods that may be more suitable for financial option data

### Repo Conventions
- Backend API runs on port 5002
- Options data is cached to improve performance
- Interpolation is used to fill gaps in options data
- Background threads are used for data fetching and cache refreshing

### Data Structures
- `OptionsDataManager`: Central manager for options data handling
- `OptionsDataProcessor`: Processes raw options data into an xarray Dataset
- `OptionsCache`: Manages caching of options data
- Options data is stored in xarray Datasets with dimensions:
  - strike: Option strike prices
  - expiration: Option expiration dates
  - option_type: Call or Put
- API returns JSON with the following structure:
  - status: Status of the request (complete, partial, loading, not_found)
  - ticker: The stock ticker symbol
  - current_price: Current price of the underlying asset
  - expiry_dates: List of available expiration dates
  - options_data: Array of option contracts with attributes like strike, expiration, option_type, bid, ask, etc.

### Plot Types Implementation
- The application now supports the following plot types:
  1. **Price**: Option mid-price (average of bid and ask)
  2. **Delta**: First derivative of option price with respect to underlying price (sensitivity to price changes)
  3. **Gamma**: Second derivative of option price with respect to underlying price (rate of change of delta)
  4. **Theta**: Rate of change of option price with respect to time (time decay)
  5. **Implied Volatility (IV)**: Market's expectation of future volatility derived from option prices
  6. **Volume**: Trading volume for each option contract
  7. **Spread**: Difference between ask and bid prices (bid-ask spread)
  8. **Intrinsic Value**: The value an option would have if exercised immediately
  9. **Extrinsic Value**: The premium above intrinsic value (time value and volatility premium)

- Implementation details:
  - Delta, gamma, and theta are calculated using both numerical methods and Black-Scholes formulas
  - Implied volatility is derived from market prices using the Black-Scholes model
  - Intrinsic value is calculated as max(0, S-K) for calls and max(0, K-S) for puts
  - Extrinsic value is calculated as (option price - intrinsic value)
  - Spread is calculated as (ask price - bid price)

# Options Visualizer Improvements

2. **Delta** - First derivative of option price with respect to underlying price
3. **Gamma** - Second derivative of option price with respect to underlying price
4. **Theta** - Rate of change of option price with respect to time
5. **IV (Implied Volatility)** - Displayed as percentage in the UI
6. **Volume** - Trading volume for the option
7. **Spread** - Difference between ask and bid prices

# Interpolation Method Improvements

## Changes Made to Interpolation Methods

### 1. Removed 1D Interpolation Fallback
- Eliminated the 1D interpolation fallback for single expiration dates
- Now using 2D interpolation exclusively for all cases
- This provides more consistent results across different datasets

### 2. Updated 2D Interpolation Method

# Options Visualizer - Agent Notes

## Architecture Overview

The Options Visualizer is a web application with a client-server architecture split into two main components:

1. **Backend API Server (Port 5002)**
   - Fetches options data from Yahoo Finance
   - Processes and calculates options metrics (Greeks, IV, etc.)
   - Caches data to improve performance
   - Exposes RESTful API endpoints

2. **Frontend Web Server (Port 5001)**
   - Serves the web interface (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Makes API calls to the backend server
   - Renders interactive visualizations using Plotly.js
   - Handles user interactions and UI updates

## Data Flow

1. User enters a ticker symbol in the web interface
2. Frontend makes API request to backend: GET /api/options/{ticker}
3. Backend checks if data is cached:
   - If cached and fresh: returns immediately
   - If cached but stale: returns cached data and refreshes in background
   - If not cached: fetches from Yahoo Finance
4. Backend processes data:
   - Calculates Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta)
   - Computes intrinsic and extrinsic values
   - Formats data for frontend consumption
5. Frontend receives data and:
   - Updates the UI with expiration dates
   - Renders the options chain visualization
   - Enables interactive features (hover, strike selection)

## Key Components

### Backend

- **OptionsDataManager**: Central manager for options data handling
- **YahooFinanceAPI**: Fetches raw options data from Yahoo Finance
- **OptionsDataProcessor**: Processes raw data into usable format
- **OptionsCache**: Caches processed data to improve performance

### Frontend

- **main.js**: Core frontend logic
- **config.js**: Configuration settings
- **style.css**: Styling for the web interface
- **index.html**: Main HTML template

## Changes Made

1. **API Endpoint Alignment**:
   - Added `/api/options/{ticker}` endpoint to match the standalone index.html
   - Updated the frontend to use this endpoint

2. **Date Format Handling**:
   - Added date format conversion to ensure consistent YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Fixed issues with date comparison and filtering

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Added more robust error handling in API calls

   ```

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```
   python -m options_visualizer_web.app
   ```

3. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5001

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Port Conflicts**:
   - If port 5001 or 5002 is already in use, change the port using the PORT environment variable
   - Update config.js to point to the correct backend port

2. **Data Loading Issues**:
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Check server logs for backend errors
   - Verify internet connection and Yahoo Finance API availability

3. **Cross-Origin Issues**:
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured in the backend
   - Check for browser security restrictions

4. **Cache Issues**:
   - Clear browser cache if frontend changes aren't reflected
   - Backend cache is automatically managed

## Future Improvements

1. **Unified Server**:
   - Combine frontend and backend into a single server for easier deployment
   - Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn

2. **Enhanced Error Recovery**:
   - Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms
   - Add automatic retries for failed API calls

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add more interactive features
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Optimize data processing for large option chains
   - Implement more efficient caching strategies

# Cache Optimization for Improved Frontend Responsiveness

## Problem Identified
The application was performing excessive processing when retrieving data from cache, which impacted frontend responsiveness. Each time data was retrieved from cache, it would undergo unnecessary reprocessing, even if it was already fully processed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Store Fully Processed Data in Cache
- Modified `_fetch_in_background` method to store the fully processed dataset in the cache
- Added the xarray Dataset object directly to the cached data with the key 'dataset'
- Added flags to indicate whether data is fully interpolated and processed

### 2. Optimize Data Retrieval from Cache
- Updated `get_current_processor` method to check if data is fully processed
- Added a fast path to skip post-processing when data is already fully processed
- Added logging to track when fully processed data is used directly

### 3. Restructured Data Processing Pipeline
- Created a unified `process_data` method that handles the entire processing pipeline
- Added helper methods `_clean_dataframe` and `_convert_to_xarray` for better code organization
- Ensured all required fields are calculated and available in the cached data

### 4. Improved Error Handling and Recovery
- Added better error handling throughout the caching and processing code
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when data is incomplete or errors occur
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues

## Benefits
1. **Faster Response Times**: Eliminates redundant processing when serving cached data
2. **Reduced CPU Usage**: Avoids recalculating expensive operations like interpolation and Greeks
3. **Better Memory Efficiency**: Stores processed data in a more efficient format
4. **Improved User Experience**: Frontend responds more quickly, especially for frequently accessed tickers

## Technical Details
- The cached data now includes the pre-computed xarray Dataset object
- A flag `_is_fully_interpolated` indicates whether the data has been fully processed
- The `get_current_processor` method now checks this flag to determine if post-processing can be skipped
- All required plot fields are calculated during the initial processing and stored in the cache

This optimization significantly reduces the processing time when retrieving data from cache, making the frontend more responsive and improving the overall user experience.

# Improved Greeks and IV Calculations

## Problem Identified
The original implementation calculated Greeks (delta, gamma, theta) using simple numerical differentiation of option prices with respect to strike price, which is not the correct approach. Additionally, the implied volatility (IV) calculation didn't leverage the interpolated price data, leading to inconsistent and potentially inaccurate results.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Delta Calculation
- Updated to calculate delta as the derivative of option price with respect to the **underlying price** (not strike)
- Created a range of underlying prices around the current price to calculate the gradient
- Used Black-Scholes model with interpolated IV to calculate option prices at different underlying prices
- Applied central difference method for more accurate numerical differentiation
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Enhanced Gamma Calculation
- Implemented gamma as the second derivative of option price with respect to underlying price
- Used a wider range of underlying prices to better capture the curvature
- Calculated delta at each underlying price, then computed the gradient of delta
- Ensured proper handling of edge cases and missing data
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Improved Theta Calculation
- Primarily used Black-Scholes theta for more accurate time decay estimation
- Added fallback to numerical differentiation when Black-Scholes calculation fails
- Used interpolated price data for numerical calculation
- Combined both approaches for maximum coverage and accuracy
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 4. Enhanced IV Calculation and Smoothing
- Used interpolated price data for more consistent IV calculations
- Added spatial interpolation to fill gaps in the IV surface
- Implemented smoothing of the IV surface to reduce noise
- Applied bounds to ensure IV values are within reasonable ranges
- Added detailed logging and error handling

## Benefits
1. **More Accurate Greeks**: The calculations now correctly represent the option sensitivities
2. **Smoother Surfaces**: Reduced noise and artifacts in the Greeks and IV surfaces
3. **Better Consistency**: Greeks and IV are now consistent with each other and with option prices
4. **Improved Robustness**: Better handling of edge cases and missing data
5. **Enhanced Visualization**: Smoother, more accurate data for plotting

## Technical Details
- Delta now represents the rate of change of option price with respect to underlying price
- Gamma correctly shows the rate of change of delta with respect to underlying price
- Theta represents the rate of change of option price with respect to time
- IV is calculated from interpolated price data and smoothed for consistency
- All calculations have proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

These improvements significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of the Greeks and IV calculations, providing users with more accurate and useful information for options analysis.
